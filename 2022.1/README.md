The resources to run the experimentations presented in the springer book on Risc-V processors in HLS.

For the riscv toolchain and tools, here are the hash value I used to do my builts (riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc version 12.2.0, spike and pk)

The hash value for riscv-gnu-toolchain is
409b951ba6621f2f115aebddfb15ce2dd78ec24f
For riscv-pk, the hash value is:
2efabd3e6604b8a9e8f70baf52f57696680c7855
And for riscv-isa-sim (spike):
