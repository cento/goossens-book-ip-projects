To base test_op_imm at address 0:

riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -nostartfiles -Ttext 0 test_op_imm.s -o test_op_imm_0.elf

To dump the based 0 executable:

riscv32-unknown-elf-objdump -d test_op_imm_0.elf > test_op_imm_0.dump
cat test_op_imm_0.dump

To transform the ELF file into binary:

riscv32-unknown-elf-objcopy -O binary test_op_imm_0.elf test_op_imm_0_text.bin
od -t x4 test_op_imm_0_text.bin

To translate binary into hexadecimal:

hexdump -v -e '"0x" /4 "%08x" ",\n"' test_op_imm_0_text.bin > test_op_imm_0_text.hex
cat test_op_imm_0_text.hex
